## 💻 What do you do on Github?
(on my profile) I'm making bootlogos for the SM6225, SM8350, etc.

I'm also working on a device tree project of each ROM for SM6225. If you want to take a look, it's here.

I'm also sharing my unofficial ROMs for SM6225 on my Telegram, so if you want to check them out, the link is there.
